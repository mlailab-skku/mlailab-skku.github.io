"Machine Learning is the domain of Artificial Intelligence that studies how to get software to perform certain cognitive tasks such as classification, prediction and clustering, getting better at it over time without human interaction"

Machine Learning Lab (ML Lab) focuses on the research about optimization methods for large-scale machine learning and image processing/computer vision/recommender system methods using deep neural network and machine learning. The Lab was directed by Prof. Joon Hee Choi from September 2019 to July 2022.

Joon Hee Choi left Sungkyunkwan University and joined Samsung Semiconductor Inc., San Jose, CA, USA in August 2022.
